# F2PY compiling error

When you use F2PY (numpy >= 1.26) to generate callable Fortran object for Python and encounter such an error

```shell
Exception: crackline: groupcounter(=0) is nonpositive. Check the blocks.
```

Make sure you delete all the **Block**s in you Fortran codes.

I really don't see the point of Block in Fortran.

Also, don't hesitate to use gbd to debug. Pycharm, sometimes, is quite annoying.
